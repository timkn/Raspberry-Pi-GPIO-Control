## Installation
* Host the files "gpio-control.php" and "gpio-control-style.css"
 on a web server, on the Raspberry Pi (e.g. Apache2)
* Install PHP on the Raspberry Pi and the web server must support PHP
* Install WiringPi on the Raspberry Pi (sometimes already preinstalled)
* use Raspberry Pi OS (Raspbian)
* :warning: JavaScript must be activated on the website

## How it works
For this project PHP, JavaScript, JQuery and Ajax were used.  
PHP executes commands from Wiring pi in the console of the Raspberry Pi.  
The console commands of Wiring pi can control the GPIOs.  


*It is my first public project* :wave:
